In the most general case, the installation process looks
quite simple, because the installation wizard tells you what to
do and your task is to agree with it filling in at the appropriate
fields some minimum of personal parameters.
It is much more difficult to prepare for installation and
plan the installation. In this regard, there is a saying: «Every
hour spent preparing will save the day necessary for the work
itself!» In addition, it is necessary to provide for the possibility
of returning to the initial state that was before the installation
in case there are any insoluble problems.
The very first solution that you will have to take before
starting the installation is which of the seven versions you
will install.
Windows 10 Home is the solution for home use. All safety
functions are kept to a minimum necessary for home use.
It is impossible to fully use the system of corporate networks.
But the cost of a license is about 3 times less
Windows 10 Professional is a solution for small and medium
businesses. Added options for increased protection of
information. Supports network and corporate security. In
most cases, this version is enough to work in organizations
Windows 10 Enterprise is designed for medium and large
organizations. Has a full set of options for work and security.
This version includes technologies that are used only in certain
cases and most users do not need them.
In our case, the choice is obvious — it’s Windows 10 Education.
In fact, it has the maximum capabilities, the same as
the version of Windows 10 Enterprise. The main difference is
licensing. Educational institutions pay for licenses much less
than commercial organizations. (For educational purposes —
free of charge)
More information about the difference between the versions
is available from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/

Before you begin the process of installing the operating
system, you must ensure that the computer hardware meets
the minimum requirements of Windows 10.
The table lists the minimum requirements for a PC that
supports Windows 10.
Hardware requirements may change over time, so to be
sure before starting the installation, you need to find the relevant
information currently available on the Microsoft website.
A PC with Windows 10 support must meet or exceed
the basic requirements for providing basic functionality of
the Windows 10 operating system. These requirements are
based on the assumption that you install only the operating
system without any additional functions. For example, you
can limit yourself to minimum requirements if you are installing
the operating system only to learn the basics of
the software. Remember, the better the hardware, the better
the performance.
The requirements for the graphics card depend on the resolution
of the monitor that you are going to use. The required
amount of video memory (it makes sense in those cases when
a discrete video card is not used and the amount of video
memory is set in the BIOS settings) is as follows:
■■ 64MB are required for one monitor with a resolution of
1310,720 pixels or less, which is equivalent to a resolution
of 1280×1024.
■■ 128MB are required for one monitor with a resolution of
2304,000 pixels or less, which is equivalent to a resolution
of 1920×1200.
■■ 256MB are required for a single monitor with a resolution
of more than 2,304,000 pixels.
If you are not sure if your computer meets the minimum
requirements, Microsoft provides some tools that can help
you determine whether the computer is compatible with
Windows 10.
Hardware Compatibility List (HCL)
In addition to meeting minimum requirements, your
equipment should be listed in the Hardware Compatibility
List (HCL) if possible. HCL is an extensive list of computers
and peripherals tested in the Windows 10 operating system.

and peripherals tested in the Windows 10 operating system.
To determine if your computer and peripherals are in HCL,
check the most recent list at https://msdn.microsoft.com/enus/
library/windows/hardware/dn922588(v=vs85).aspx.
The Windows 10 operating system requires management
of the equipment to ensure stability, efficiency, and safety.
Hardware and supported HCL drivers have passed thorough
tests to ensure their compatibility with Windows 10. Microsoft
ensures that the devices in the list meet the requirements for
Windows 10 and do not have any incompatibilities that could
affect the stability of the system. If you call Microsoft support,
the first thing a support engineer will ask is your configuration.
If you have any hardware that is not in the HCL, you will
not be able to get support from Microsoft.
Compatibility with BIOS
Before installing Windows 10, you should make sure that
your motherboard has the latest BIOS version installed. This
is especially important if your current BIOS does not support
Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI).
For normal operation of Windows 10, this technology is required.
Check the BIOS version information on the website
of the computer’s motherboard manufacturer.
Requirements to Drivers
To successfully install Windows 10, you must have the necessary
device drivers for your computer, such as a hard disk
driver. In the tools of Windows 10, there is an extensive list
of drivers, but in spite of this, it is possible that the necessary
driver will not be on the installation disc. In this case, you will
have to visit the manufacturer’s website again to find the necessary
drivers.
New Installation or Update?
Once you have determined that your equipment meets
the minimum requirements, you need to decide if you want
to perform an update or a clean installation. The update allows
you to save existing applications, settings, and operating
system files. The bad news is that you will not be able to
upgrade if you have Windows Vista, Windows XP, or an earlier
version of Windows installed on your computer. You will
need to perform a clean installation. (However, you can use
a third-party tool, such as the Laplink utility, to transfer files
and settings from Windows XP to Windows 10 on the same
computer.)
You can upgrade to Windows 10 if the following conditions
are true:
■■ You are using Windows 7 or Windows 8.
■■ You want to keep your existing applications and settings.
■■ You want to keep local users and groups created by you.
You must perform a clean installation of Windows 10 if
one of the following conditions is true:
■■ Operating system is not installed at the moment.
■■ You have an operating system that does not support an inplace
upgrade to Windows 10 (for example, DOS, Windows
9x, Windows NT, Windows Me, Windows 2000
Professional, Windows Vista, or Windows XP).
■■ You want to start from scratch, without saving any existing
settings.
■■ You want to be able to dual boot between Windows 10
and the previous operating system.
Ugrade Considerations
Almost all applications of Windows 7 and Windows 8
should work with the operating system Windows 10. However,
exceptions are possible, namely:
■■ Applications that use file system filters, such as antivirus
programs, may be incompatible.
■■ Custom power management tools may not be supported.
Before upgrading to Windows 10, be sure to stop the anti-
virus scanners, network services or other client software.
These software packages can decide that installing Windows 10
is a virus and start to prevent it in every possible way. If you
perform a clean install on the same partition as the existing
version of Windows, the contents of the Users (or Documents
